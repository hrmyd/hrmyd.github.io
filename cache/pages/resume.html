<h1 class="resume"> Summary </h1>

<p>In my most recent position, I was a <strong>Data Scientist</strong> at Vacasa where I was the primary data scientist working with the operations department. In my last few months I worked with our personalization team in Boise as well. My focus has been on developing all aspects that go into a successful data scientist; from rounding out my engineering skillset for model deployment, improving my public speaking, to finding opportunities for collaboration between teams, I enjoy any chance to challenge myself and go outside my comfort zone!</p>

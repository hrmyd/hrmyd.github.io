University of Oregon alumni living in Portland, OR. I graduated with a degree in Biochemistry and ended up getting interested in programming towards the end of school.
I worked in two molecular biology labs where I combined biology and computer science for analysis of various experiments. 

Currently, I work as an Associate Data Scientist at Vacasa where I've been for the last year. In my free time I can usually be found baking, messing around with film photography, or taking care of my ever growing plant collection.

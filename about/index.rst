University of Oregon alumni living in Portland, OR. I graduated with a degree in Biochemistry and became interested in programming towards the end of school.
I worked in two molecular biology labs where I combined biology and computer science for analysis of various experiments. 

Currently, I work as a data scientist at Vacasa where I've been for the last couple years. 
In my free time I can usually be found baking, messing around with film photography, keeping my plants alive, knitting, or hanging out with my pup.
